## Project Motivation
this is a project to evaluate a survey done on passengers of an airline to measures their satisfaction on the service given
so IÂ have taken this dataset to
practice my programming skill in python and answer a few questions of interest

 1. Question 1 : Is there a relation between any of the satisfaction levels and the overall Satisfaction ?
 
 2. Question 2 : Does the biological Factors like age , gender and Hours spent on flight affect the overall Satisfaction ?
 
 3. Question 3 : Does the in-flight entertainment is specified for a certain age ?
